z
srce worry
. `You know Reimu's yin-yang orbs? Last night, the orbs suddenly cloaked themselves in a terrifying aura reminiscent of a vengeful spirit. I have no idea why. The situation has remained static since then, but it's highly dangerous as-is.`
z
. `I don't know any more than that. As long as the orbs are in this questionable state, we can't let Reimu use any of her Hakurei powers. We'd risk infecting her too. Keine told me she'd take care of Reimu, though.`
z
slce worry
. `I guess I expected something along those lines. So? What do you want me to do with the orbs? Smash them? Burn them? I could probably even eat them.`

. `Smash them if worse comes to worst. Yukari said she'd be investigating alternatives, but she hasn't returned yet.`

. `Alright. If that's all, I should go find Yukari, right? Can you point me in the right direction?`

How did you find this place?`

. `I guess there were a few seals or something in the area, but they were nothing compared to the bamboo forest. What, were those things supposed to stop me?`
z
srce angry
. `I have no choice. I can't let you leave this place alive.`
z
slc
. `If you don't want people to come to your house, don't invite them over. That's kept people away from my place for over a millennium now.`
z
