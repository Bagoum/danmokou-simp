. `Eirin's part of the operation, isn't she? Why did she have you come out here? And where's the rabbit?`
z
srce worry
. `I don't know about an operation... Eirin just asked me to collect some rare poisonous mushrooms and to absolutely not be seen...`
z
srce happy
. `And Reisen is serving as guine-- excuse me, Tewi made her eat something weird, so she's resting at Eientei.`

. `Well, if you had attacked Yukari like that, you probably would have gotten killed. Count yourself lucky you ran into me.`
z
srce happy
. `That's just the risk of picking mushrooms here, right? Even now, she might appear out of thin air and murder us both.
Could you call that lover's suicide, technically?`
z
slce worry
. `That... probably won't happen. Not today, anyways, since Yukari is part of the incident resolution team.`
z
srce cry
. `I didn't hear about any incident! Why am I the only one out of the loop?`
z
slce worry
. `You're too lazy to do incident resolution.`
z
srce angry
. `I'm not lazy, I'm busy! Busy playing video games!`

z
srce worry
. `Oh, I'm out of time. I need to get back to Eientei. I'll ask Eirin for the details on the incident. I won't sit this one out!`

. `In that case, when you're there, tell Eirin this:
"Because you didn't explain the context behind this mushroom-gathering trip, I nearly incapacitated Mokou and threw the whole plan into chaos."`
z
srce happy
. `Is that how it is? Were my imitation danmaku that difficult for you to dodge? You've lost your edge.`
z
slce angry
. `Don't act so damn haughty when people are trying to help you!
I just want her to stop leaving you out of the loop. Because it causes problems for me. That's all.`
z
srce worry
. `If you say so...
Oh, also, are we still on for day after tomorrow?`
z
slce _
. `As long as this incident is resolved by then.
Well, I still want to go fishing today, so I'm planning to clean it all up within a few hours.`
z
srce happy
. `Awesome! See you soon, then!`
