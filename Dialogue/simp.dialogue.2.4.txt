z

. `I don't know if she's strong, but it takes a lot of wisdom to be able to detect an incident so quickly.`

You've seen the tower in the Forest of Magic, right?`
z
. `This device can send messages through the air to that tower, and that tower can send messages through the air to this device.`
z
. `So you can talk to anyone else with the same device, as long as you're both within range of the tower.`
z
srce happy
. `I sent Chen to deliver one to Kamishirasawa, along with my plans. I didn't expect you to get here before me, but with this device, you won't have to backtrack.`

A warning.`
z
srce angry
. `Fujiwara. If you fail, I'll have to step in.
And that will be the second-worst outcome. For everyone.`
z
. `Don't screw up. Kamishirasawa might trust you, but I don't trust her and I don't trust you. I'm only working with you because I can't involve Reimu.`
z
srce happy
. `And on that note... I'm going to sleep. When I wake up, I expect to see this incident resolved.`

Hah! Do I have a beam in my eye or something?`
