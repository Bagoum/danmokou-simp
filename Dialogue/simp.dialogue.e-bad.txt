. `<silent>As that nameless weirdo promised, my involvement in the incident ended today.`

.z `<silent>Reimu and Mima are both resting at Eirin's place. Whatever Mima did to the orbs seems to have resolved the incident, but also has taken quite the toll on both of them.`
.z `<silent>Now that the incident is over, whatever happens to the Hakurei Shrine is not my problem.`
.z `<silent>Whatever happens between Reimu and Mima when they wake up is not my problem.`
.z `<silent>Whatever happens to Seija or that supposedly fake hermit is not my problem.`
.z `<silent>The only thing I have to worry about now... is going fishing.`
.z `<silent>I left Eientei and weaved through the thickest clusters of the forest, heading towards the lake near my hut.`

. `<silent>But by the time I reached the lake, the nightbugs had already begun their disorganized, yet somehow harmonious, rehearsal. 
I screwed up. It's too late to fish today.`
z
. `<silent>I sat down, pushing my back against one of the smoother trees. Sleeping against rough tree bark is nice, but sleeping against a familiar tree is slightly better.`
z
. `<silent>Yet in the process of becoming familiar with a tree, you inevitably sand away at its rough edges. This is, in some form, the paradox of immortality itself.`
z
. `<silent>I pray every night to wake up with the desire to do something.`
z
. `<silent>In this life where the consequences of every action will crumble before my own eyes, where there is no movement or goal with any meaning, the most valuable feeling is that of a random and shallow impulse to act.`
z
. `<silent>Without those capricious moments, I might give up on getting up altogether.`
z
. `<silent>I turned my head to face the flattened circle of grass where, had I come earlier, I would have sat. The gear I had left there in the morning lay unmoving, untouched.`
z
. `<silent>Nowadays, the only whims I come across involve fishing, eating with Keine, or killing Kaguya. I need to treasure them better.`
z
. `<silent>With that last thought, I leaned my head against the tree bark and slept.`
z
. `<silent>(Bad End! Try for a 1CC next time!)`
