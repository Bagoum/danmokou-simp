.z `<silent>Now that the incident is over, whatever happens to the Hakurei Shrine is not my problem.`
.z `<silent>Whatever happens between Reimu and Mima when they wake up is not my problem.`
.z `<silent>Whatever happens to Seija or that supposedly fake hermit is not my problem.`

srce surprise
. `"Kaguya?! What are you doing here?! And why do you have my fishing rod?!"`
z
. `<silent>A challenge? No, we had a duel scheduled fairly soon. There was no reason for her to one-sidedly push the date forward. A surprise attack, then? No, she was too vulnerable in this situation.`
