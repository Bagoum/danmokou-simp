.z `No, I just remembered that I made a promise to Mokou...`
srce cry
.z `And that promise will only hold water if you're the one who clears up this incident. So if I kill you, I'd break that promise.`
slc
.z `Wait, that doesn't make sense. How could your promise rely on my actions when you didn't know about my existence until just now?`
srce worry
.z `It didn't have to be you in particular. All we needed was for one person to defeat Mokou and then clear up the incident. Since you defeated Mokou, you need to defeat the final boss as well.`

.z `So... you're not going to fight me?`

.z `Well, I have to keep my promises. So I can't fight you unless I do so with the intent to lose.`
