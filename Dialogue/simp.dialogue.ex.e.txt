.z `<silent>I raised my left fist with only my index finger extended, letting it lean slightly backwards to feign an air of nonchalant wisdom.`
.z `<silent>I have trained, through entirely aboveboard means, most characters in Gensoukyou to listen to me carefully when I do this.`
.z `<silent>This time is, after all, the most important part of an incident. Not the problem, not the solution, but the lies that clear the board and allow the denizens of this land to move on with their lives.`
.z `"We had two sequential incidents, but they were completely unrelated.`
.z `Last week, some anomalies arose in the barrier by this shrine due to a mistake Reimu made several years ago, and as you know, Fujiwara repaired them.`
.z `The other day, some grunts from Hell came looking for something, but they were unacceptably messy, so a friend of mine, who wishes to remain unnamed, sent them packing."`
.z `<silent>Three sentences, three lies. Plus a fourth if you include my convenient omission of the fact that I was responsible for the latter of the two incidents.`
sl marisa
.z `<silent>The thief was lying down on the shrine's platform, her face spared from the sun's rays by the overhang, and her feet dangling loosely over the edge.</silent> "Was prolly that wicked hermit's fault 'gain. She should jus' hurry up and die already, ze."`
sl yukari
.z `<silent>In most cases, I don't need to make my explanations as public as this. I can usually speak with the related individual parties privately. People are not pure like shikigami; the more you put together, the more errors and unexpected behaviors arise.`
sle keine worry
.z `<silent>Keine, in her position of both sight and blindness, spoke to clear the fog in front of her eyes.</silent>
"What about Mokou? I thought she might have figured out the problem and gone to resolve it herself."`
sle marisa surprise
.z `"Mokou? Tha's right. I saw 'er while I was scoutin' around for the second incident. She was lyin' dead in a clearing sumwhere."`
sl yukari
.z `<silent>And here, I shall fulfill my promise.`
slce worry
.z `"That's right. Mokou was in a privileged position for the first incident, as a human unrelated to the Hakurei Shrine, but when it comes to a standard brawl with some lunatic or another, she really can't do much."`
.z `"She even picked a fight with my unnamed friend, but she got wiped out so quickly that we never found out just what she was doing during the second incident."`
sle sanae cry
.z `<silent>There's the green idiot, waving her purification rod around in the air, mocking some kind of sword.</silent>
"Hey! What about me?! I'm powerful and human! You could have asked me for help instead of Mokou, if she's so weak!"`
sle marisa worry
.z `"Yer a shrine maiden, so yer automatic'lly related to the Hakurei Shrine."`
sle reimu angry
.z `<silent>Reimu, barely able to keep track of the discussion, finally spoke.</silent>
"Wait, wait. I don't get it. Why didn't I hear about this first incident? It's my damn shrine!"`
sle yukari _
.z `<silent>I don't have to speak here. In this situation, it's Keine who has to cover her own ass.`
sle keine worry
.z `"Oh, uh, you see... Kasen was going to tell you, but when she got to the shrine, you were suffering from an acute case of food poisoning. So she took you to Eirin's place and asked me and Mokou to resolve the incident in your stead."`
sle yukari _
.z `<silent>And thus, another lie woven, another promise kept.`
.z `<silent>As for those two...`
.z `<silent>Mima defeated Shinki and became the god of Makai. 
In title only, for what it's worth. Apparently she has no interest in the world itself.`
.z `<silent>I understand that titles are important, but... does such a title really make a difference?`
.z `<silent>Well, it's not my problem. Though I should consider stealing that title away from her as payback for her insult, which I, petty as I am, will never forgive.`
.z `<silent>(Extra Stage Complete!)`
